summary: Verify that the interface.allow-auto-connection setting works

details: |
    Using different snaps that require interface connections, check each of the options
    for interface.<if>.allow-auto-connection works like they are expected. The supported
    interfaces are the builtin ones in snapd.

    snap set system interface.network.allow-auto-connection=true
    snap remove test-snapd-curl || true
